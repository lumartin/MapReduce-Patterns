The way in which he uses the shapes and tells the little stories is absolutely adorable, but he also explains everything fantastically, and is so delightful to watch. This is definitely worth a look if you have 8 minutes to spare. Enjoy!</p>

But, my advice, stick it out here like you are doing; this is a fantastically taught class. </p>

<p>I guess my point is I hope to see more content that is driven on the connections between languages, and respectively, I hope to see full-fledged courses based on those said languages, i.e., JavaScript course, C++, OCaml, etc.  Building on what we know in Python is a fantastically seamless transition and is comforting considering how alien some of these concepts might seem.</p>
