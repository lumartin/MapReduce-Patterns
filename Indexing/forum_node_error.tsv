<p>When you are logged in you should try to find a unregistered ""nickname"" and register it. Once you get that done you can go to #freenode channel and request having a ""Cloak"" applied to your nickname. One of the reasons is that without a cloak someone can easily look up your IP Address through your hostname which usually looks something like ""12-34-5-678.LA.fios.verizon"" .
